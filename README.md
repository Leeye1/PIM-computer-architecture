# Processing In Memory (PIM) Computer Architecture

## Overview
This course project explored a **custom PIM-based architecture** with ISA extensions and compiler support.  
We simulated the architecture on GEM5 and achieved up to **3× speedup** on SPEC benchmarks compared with the baseline.

## Features
- Proposed ISA extensions for memory-intensive operations
- Implemented compiler support for new instructions
- Simulated the design on GEM5
- Evaluated performance with SPEC benchmarks
- Produced architecture diagrams, workflow charts, and a technical report

## Results
- Up to **3× performance improvement** on selected SPEC benchmarks
- Visualization of performance trends available in [`results/`](./results)

## Repository Map

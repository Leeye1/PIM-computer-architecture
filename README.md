# Processing In Memory (PIM) Computer Architecture

## Overview
This course project proposed and simulated a **custom PIM-based computer architecture**.  
We extended the ISA, implemented compiler support, and evaluated performance using GEM5 simulations.  
**Results**: Up to **3× speedup** on selected SPEC benchmarks compared to the baseline.

## Repository Layout
- `code/` – Compiler code and GEM5 configuration
- `demo/` – Video demonstrations of running benchmarks
- `results/` – Benchmark outputs and visualization (Excel + figures)
- `slides/` – Presentation slides with methodology and results
- `docs/` – Project website (GitHub Pages)

## Results
Key benchmark results and visualization are in [`results/`](./results).  
A full overview is also available on the [GitHub Page](https://your-username.github.io/pim-computer-architecture).

## Tech Stack
- GEM5
- Compiler design (Python)
- ISA extension design

## Contributors
Led by **Yi Ling** with a 4-member team.
